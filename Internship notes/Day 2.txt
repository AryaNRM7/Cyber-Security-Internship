Introduction to Cyber security and Ethical hacking

Hack value : the interest the hacker has over the target 
Vulnerability : A weak point or a loop hole that exists in a software program which leads the hacker to gain unauthorised access 
also called as  FLAW   in design of a software
			BUG     as a mistake in coding of a program
			WEAKNESS exists in the libraries or the encryption developer uses
Exploit : is a code that takes advantage of a software vulnerlability in order to gain unauthorized access
Payload : actual message transferred betwween devices
		a payload ia a portion of malware which performs malicious actions
Zeroday vulnerability : Vulnerability found by any hacker except the developer after the release of software
zeroday attack : attack performed by hackers using zeroday vulnerability before the first patch is given to the vuln
Doxing : gathering private and publicly available information of an individual or an organistaion using internet resources and publishing them in the internet

Attack : an attempt to break the security of a system
	Goal = hackvalue
	methods to follow
	Vulnerability
Patch : a fix to the vulnerability

Elements of IS:
CIA traids - Security model created to guide information security
Confidentiality
Integrity : trust of data not being modified by the unautorised
Availabiltity
Authenticity
Non Repudiation

Threats in information security
Network Threats - 
	Information gathering : hacker can gather info from devices
	Sniffing and Eaves Dropping : hacker can steal user id and passwords
	Password based attacks 
	DOS attack : Denial of service attack
	
Host threats - 
	malware attacks 
	unauthorized access
	backdoor attack : software which give alternate access to hackers
	physical secutriy Threats : deivce cant be used again after this type of an attack
Application threats -
	Improper data or input validation : no proper validation
	Information disclosure : sensitive info will not be protected correctly by the developers
	security misconfiguration : if security is not configuerd properly
	Buffer overflow attack : during verfification of data , the data is sent without verification in this type of threats
