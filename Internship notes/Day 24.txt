XSS or cross site scripting :

Google dorks to find websites with xss vuln :
extn : client side : .html,.js,.css
	  server side : .php,.aspx,.jsp
Dork for search pages :
For php :
inurl:search.php  site:in/pk/us/cn
inurl:/search.php
for jsp:
inurl:search.jsp
inurl:/search.jsp
for aspx (.net framework)
inurl:search.aspx
inurl:/search.aspx

For Comment pages :
inurl:comment.php
inurl:/comment.php
inurl:?comment.php


<script>alert(123)</script>

XSS exists if :
input is returned back in
1.in the same input fiels
2.anywhere inside the page
3.can be in the url

Counter measures for XSS :
-Filter the input on arrival :
	When the input is given to the website , the extra content should be eliminated in the serverr side
-using url encoding :
	the special characters are encoded using ascii encoding
	like %3,%c
-using html encoding:
	it is also same as url encoding but is done inside html
-using content security policy :
	combination of all mentioned above along with using appropraite response header
	like : X-XSS-PROTECTION: 1;mode=block
should be done on dev side

Solution for zero day vuln or any other XSS vuln:
No script : browser extension :
restricts the execution of js func in the website u visit.
can also provide security from phishing pages


SQL Injection:
Structured Query Language
few db languages:
SQL
TSQL
POSTGRESQL
mySQL

When user gives uid and pss
db lang creates a query
chechk the db
then returns the user a response

For sql injection:
uid : '=' 'OR'
pass : '=' 'OR'

This query gives direct authorization to the attacker
