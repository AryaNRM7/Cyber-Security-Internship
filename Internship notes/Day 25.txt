1.In-band Sql injection:
attacker can use same channel of attck to launch the attack and gather the results  
 types of In-band Sql injection
	1.error based :
		the error on the sever side should be handles on the server side or else it is vulnerable to error based sql injection
	For ecommerce website :
		 parameters after question mark will send as a sql query
		A hacker wantedly gives special characters or other characters in the sql query to check whether the web app is vuln to error sql injection.
 	if the hacker gets an error returned to him by the databse,then he can access he entire database.
	2.union based
		used to combine two queries and execute on the server side using union operator

2.inferential SQL injection
no information will be provided to the hacker by the database
in this case
The hacekr will just send home reconstructed SQL payloads
observes the websites response 
by analyszing the behaviour of the website the hacker understands that there is an SQL injection vuln
