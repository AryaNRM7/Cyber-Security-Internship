To perform netbios enumeration
Super scan and netbios enumerator are used

Each and every OS has a netbios service running within local area network

if a os blocks our scan request in the nmap ...... we have to use intense scan with no ping scan

****To bypass the firewall we have to slow comprehensive scan

There are some devices which dont have a password and also there are some users who enable admin acc and they forget to disable it

Every user should have a strong password

Gaining access 
 the hacker performs exploitation on vulnerabilities in order to gain unauthorized access

techniques the hacker uses inorder to perform exploitation




the hacker needs to find vulnerabilities
he can do it in two ways
finding vulnerabilities manually with physical access
	hacker needs to bypass the login
	beginner level password changing technique
	to do this he needs following
		physical access
		system should be booted up
		user account should be logged in
		******there is a tool called net user tool which is used to manage 				user information
		command : net user
		to change the password of the user
		command  : net user acc_name pass
		ex : net user AryaN 123456****
There are advanced settings the hacker can change the password or get the current password without even the system being booted up.
finding vulnerabilities with automatic tools
	vulnerability assesment tools in order to find the vulnerabhiities on the target network and the target devices

****Advanced Tool called NESSUS
it has a built in Nmap
