Sniffing : 
Is a process of capturing and monitoring of the data packets passing through the network using sniffers

Sniffing is not a hacking technique they are used for diagnostics and observe the network traffic to trouble shoot the issues in the network

The sniffing is performed by making the NIC card run into promicious mode . 

promicious mode : it is a mode where the NIC card will recieve and respond to the datapackets which are not intented to it.

Once the sniffing is successful the attacker can perform some attacks like 
Session Hijacking
	Session : An identification given to u as an authorized user
	the session id which was generetaed for the user by recognizing the user as 	authorixed is captured by the attacker and made control over the user is 	called Session Hijacking
DOS attack
MITM(Man in the middle) attack
	The attacker will come in between of the request blw client and the server

Sniffing can only be performed when the attacker is in the same lan network

Sniffing tools convert the nic card into promicious mode and they capture data packets in the network

Types:
Active :
	The attcker sends malicious data packets to the target device in order to capture the data
Bus topology and Hub Network
Passive:
	The attcker doent send any malicious data packets to the target device in order to capture the data
Star topology and Switch adn Router Network


Counter measures against active/passive sniffing attacks : 

Use https instead of http
Use SFTP instaed of FTP
Use advanced steganography methods
use switch or router instead of Hub
Use sniffing detection tools/promicious devices detection tools
