Nslookup tool used to find the records in the DNS
bulit in with windows and linux

syn: nslookup domain_name
ex : nslookup facebook.com

For specific domain records

syn : nslookup -type= recordtype domain_name
ex : nslookup -type= AAAA facebook.com


Online paltofrm : dnslookup.online

Footprinting of target server

hacker finds
- IP ADDRESS using a tool called PING comes inbuilt with windows and linux
syn : ping domain_name

mgit.ac.in : 65.2.53.139

- REVERSE IP LOOKUP  : it is used to find the co hosted websites on the target server's network

online platform : hacker target.com

- SUB DOMAINS OF A TARGET DOMAIN 
This process is also called SUB DOMAIN  ENUMERATION
online platform : virustotal.com
this is used to find subdomains

some of the sensitive domains are : cpanel


there is another tool : sublist3r built in python
Sublist3r 
installation

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install requests
python -m pip install dnspyhton
python setup.py install

pip - pyhton interpreter

to get subdomains
sublist3r -d mgit.ac.in

----------------------------------------------
Footprinting using Social engineering

psycological manupulation actions which help get confidential info

ex  : phishing : fake links
	SMShing - fake sms
	Vishing - fake voice calls
	

to grab the ip address of the victim the hacker uses ip logging technique
they give fake links which help hacker to get ip address,approx address, device details

open source platform : Grabifyip
steps : 
-select an image
- it creates an fake link
then ucan send it and find those ip addressess in the results section

to avoid ourselves from using this type of links
use Redirect Detective website

---------------------------------------------------------------
footprinting using SHODAN.io and osinetworkframework

shodan.io - different devices connected in open networks can be grabbed by shodan

OSINTFRAMEWORK.COM

Second phase of Ethical hacking
Scanning
Also called as NETWORK SCANNING
this process is used to find the devices in the network

beginner level objectives of netwrok scanning:
these are basic techniques
-to find devices live in the netwrok
-find open and close ports
-services and thier versions
-os
-banner info
-firewalls and to bypass them
-and should use a vpn to stay anonymous

there are other 10 advanced scanning techniques........which we will learn in advanced internship

port is a gateway for data transfer between devices
open port : packets can be transferred
closed port : packets cannot be transferred ,ports are closed by firewall

port number : it is used to direct the data to correct location within the device
65536 ports available in each device
range of port numbre 0 - 65535  ex : 80 - http,443 - https,53 - DNS

Each and every port number has its own protocol
netbios : network basic input output system

*for some domains we have to use www. to ping the ipaddress

domain : tapsyaedu.com 
ip : 103.210.75.45

103.210.75.1 - 103.210.75.255

**if we get a IPv6 address,we have to use the nslookup command to find the IPv4 address

pingsweep technique is used to ping all the ip addresses in a given range

--pingsweep tools
ANGRY IP SCANNER
	red - device doesnt exist
	green - the device as two open ports 80 and 443
	blue - device is live
ADVANCED IP SCANNER

--NMAP : 
used for network scanning
it is called a swiss army knife refers to that it can be used for multiple uses
used to find ip,ports,services etcc

in target field we can give
ip addr
ip addr range
domain name

if a service is given as tdwrapped after completion of scan that means that it has a firewall

Nmap will only scan 1000 ports by default
time taken to analuze depends on the target site


--*To find the os of a device and to find the banner details there is an alternative online paltform

SITEREPORT.NETCRAFT.COM
this give info about
domain info
dns admin info
ipaddr details
network configuration
hosting history
