ARP spoofing :
This attack is used by hackers to perform MITM attack

Arp: address resolution protocol
it is used to map MAC addressess to their respective IP addresses and vice versa 

Arp spoofing atack : 
Hacker sends a forged ARP reply to the router device saying that his device is the victim device .

Each and every device know their Ip addresses But they dont know their MAC addresses
If the hacker performs MAC spoofing and then performs Arp spoofing he might not get alll the packets

In switch and router network a CAM table is maintained to identify which mac address is on which ip and on which port  
While the Arp spoofing is being done the CAM table is updated with the forged replies of the hacker
