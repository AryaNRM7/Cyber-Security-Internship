Nessus is a vulnerability assesment tool
Hacker  - Pentester

Vulnerability assesment is a phase in hacking which we analyse the weaknesses which might help the hacker to attack and gain access

Few Types of Vulnerability assesment
Active
	interacts directly to targets network and devices and finds vuls
Passive
	performs sniffing to find vuls

Vulnerability Scoring System  : vuls are given scoring based on their risk factor and categorized as :
info 		:	0 - 0.9
low  		:	1 - 3.9
medium 	:	4.0 - 6.9
high  	:	7.0 - 8.9
critical 	:	9.0 - 10.0 
This is called as common vulnerability scoring system CVSS
Score depends on bug criticality
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Common vulnerability and Exposure

CVE.MITRE.ORG : all the vulnerabilities are gathered and their info is diclosed there
Each and every vul has an id number given by cve called CVE number
Ex : CVE-2020-1234 - number of the vul found in that year
		    |
		year in which it was found
