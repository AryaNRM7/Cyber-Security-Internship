Few attacks that can be performed by hacker after sniffing :
Session hacking
DOS attack
password Stealing
By passing firewalls/IDS/IPS

IDS : Intrusion Detection System
IPS : Intrusion Prevention System

 
Session Hijacking :
It is a process where the user,s session is taken over by the attacker in different ways.
FEW reasons : 
predictable session id
Session sniffing
client side attacks(based on vuln in the websites or servers)
MITM attack
MITB attack(Browser)

Session : An identifeir to the user who is authorized from log in to log out in a service .

Session ID / Token : it is stored in the respective storage
It is sent in the URL


predictable session id : service generates session ids which can be predictable and can be easily guessable
After session hijacking hacker can perform alll the tasks performed by user can be done by hacker

Session Sniffing :
By performing network sniffing the hacker can capture and gain the valid users session ids and this happens if the data packets are not encrypted

THis can be done within the network only

CLient side Attacks :Using malicious content

MITM attacks : Data packets are taken by the hacker

MITB attack :Data packets coming from the browser are only considered.

Website : 
Session id/token is saved in the browser
they are stored in the cookies and stored in the browser

Cookie Hijacking /Cookie Stealing :
 Cookie Bro extension
Export and import cookies

By passing firewalls/IDS/IPS:
The most common technique that hackers use to bypass would be by using cryptography tchniques for theie expliots/malwares/payloads

Honeypots : 
Traps for hackers which are a replica of an internal network .

Types :
High interaction honey pots
Medium interaction honey pots
Low interaction honey pots
